            This is a stock (non-dahliaOS) Fuchsia image with the emulator
            included, designed to run on nearly any Linux machine. You will need
            at least 4GB of RAM and NaN of storage space in order to run the VM.
            The image can also be extracted and run on hardware using an
            external drive. Fuchsia is still far from beta so this image and
            software is for testing purposes only. This image is compiled by the
            dahliaOS team and is neither endorsed nor approved of by Google.
